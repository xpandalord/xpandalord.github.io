Hi, I'm Andy Tran, a data scientist focused on helping professional businesses and tech startups understand their customers and recommend the right decisions. To do this, I specialize in recommender systems, natural language processing, and deploying machine learning models with user interfaces.

Studying mathematics taught me to analyze big data. Growing up with games taught me to strategize. I'd love to work with you to solve business problems using math and code.

### Recommenders
I've learned techniques for the "cold start" problem - making recommendations for new users without much information. Offline, salespeople build rapport, but online, how can we learn quickly? To explore this, I developed a game recommender app that learns your taste in just 10 questions. I gained experience with collaborative filtering and content-based approaches, using Python's scikit-learn and Surprise libraries.

### Natural Language Processing
I'm experienced scraping, processing, and analyzing unstructured text data with Python, including NLTK and spaCy.

### Deploying models
I prototype in Jupyter Notebook, with pandas to wrangle, matplotlib to visualize, and scikit-learn to model. Then I deploy interactive web apps to make models useful. I use Plotly Dash, a framework built on React, D3, and Flask.

### Mathematics
Growing up I had natural talent for mathematics, so I continued studying in college. Now I'm excited to apply these skills to new, practical problems. Mathematics backgrounds are common for data scientits.

### Computer Science
I've been growing up playing and then developing video games, so I'm comfortable about creative thinking and strategizing. Whatever your industry, I can learn the language and help translate business problems into data science solutions.
