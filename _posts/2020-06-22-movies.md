# Factors
## Rating
Using the following dataset from Kaggle, [Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney), let's determine which movie rating system to use when figuring out what movie to watch. The dataset gives us ratings from Internet Movie Database(IMDb), where movies are rated out of 10, as well as from Rotten Tomatoes, where movies are rated out of 100. We will convert IMDb's ratings into out of a 100 to make the ratings more consistent. The top 10 movie from each rating system is as follows:
