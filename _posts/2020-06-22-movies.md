# Factors
## Rating
Using the following dataset from Kaggle, [Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney), let's determine which movie rating system to use when figuring out what movie to watch. The dataset gives us ratings from Internet Movie Database(IMDb), where movies are rated out of 10, as well as from Rotten Tomatoes, where movies are rated out of 100. We will convert IMDb's ratings into out of a 100 to make the ratings more consistent.

The top 10 movie by IMDb is:

The top 10 movie by Rotten Tomatoes is:

This discrepancy amoung the top 10 movies of each rating system shows how vastly different each system views these movies. Thus we must dive deeper to learn about the truth.

## Correlation Coefficient
By using the correlation coefficient for each numeric column paired with another numeric column, we can see how much of an influence they have on each other.

The correlation coefficient of the variables:

In the case of choosing based off of one aspect of the movie, such as platform or runtime, by the correlation coefficient, it seems that movies that are on Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney+ are more strongly correlated to IMDb ratings than they are to Rotten Tomatoes, vice versa for movies on Hulu. There also appears to be a stronger correlation between Runtime and IMDb ratings than Runtime and Rotten Tomatoes ratings. Thus, only movies on Hulu are more accurately rated on Rotten Tomatoes than on IMDb. In other words, in general for all movies on other platforms, viewers should consult IMDb for an accurate rating of those movies. In the event that a viewer wants a movie based off of its runtime, IMDb also more accurately distinguishes its ratings based off of runtime compared to Rotten Tomatoes. This could be due to having higher ratings on movies that have a much higher runtime due to the budget of that movie and vice versa for movies with low runtime due to low budget.
