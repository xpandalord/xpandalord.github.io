As a learning experience, I recreated this data visualization from FiveThirtyEight's article, [How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump's Response]

I learned about:
- Exploratory vs Explanatory visualization
- Pandas data wrangling and crosstabs
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas plotting

You can see the details, including code and comments, in [my Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15agD_PJtyqtT9iBBUhLfGqNywclPhVrS?usp=sharing).
